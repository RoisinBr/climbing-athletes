# Australian Climbing Athlete Database

## The Requirement
Currently there is no record of Australian history in the sport of Climbing.  With the introduction of climbing in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and therefore the greater media attention there has been no greater need to keep track of Australian History and records set by our competitors.  

## The Solution
This app displays all results from the IFSC for our Australian athletes.  This data can be sorted to view the best results for each of the climbers.

## The Limitations
This data is dependent on IFSC records which is live and accurate however does not have all the required data.  For example: Australian state of residency and national boulder, lead and speed rankings.  This requires data to be collected from several sources.

## Future Direction
- Filter by state using select.
- The ability for athletes to log in and update their own profiles.
- Automatic determination of international records.
- Filter records by junior/adult and by discipline.
- Automatic updates from IFSC.
